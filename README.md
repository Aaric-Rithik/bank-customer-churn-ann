# Bank Customer Churn Prediction (ANN)

This project predicts whether a bank customer is likely to churn using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**.
It includes data preprocessing, model training, and a **Streamlit-based web application** for real-time predictions.

---

## Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge for banks. This project uses historical customer data and a trained ANN model to estimate churn probability based on demographic and financial attributes.

The application allows users to input customer details and instantly see churn likelihood.

## Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **TensorFlow / Keras**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Pandas, NumPy**
* **Streamlit**
* **Pickle**

---

## Features

* ANN-based churn prediction model
* One-hot encoding for categorical variables
* Feature scaling using StandardScaler
* Interactive Streamlit UI for predictions
* Clean separation of model, preprocessing, and UI

---

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)

1. User enters customer details (age, balance, credit score, etc.)
2. Inputs are encoded and scaled using trained preprocessors
3. ANN model predicts churn probability
4. App displays whether the customer is **likely to churn or not**

---

## How to Run the Application

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
